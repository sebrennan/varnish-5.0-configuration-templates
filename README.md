## Varnish Configuration Templates (boilerplate)

### ðŸš€ Need help implementing Varnish?

I'm available [for consultancy](https://ma.ttias.be/consultancy/) if you're struggling with implementing Varnish and speeding up your site. Don't be afraid to [reach out!](https://ma.ttias.be/consultancy/)

### Installation

You can use the configuration templates found in this repository to quickly get started with a complete Varnish configuration that offers support for most functionality. Start of by looking into "default.vcl" and taking the bits you need, copy it to your own default.vcl.

### What is it?

A set of configuration samples used for Varnish 5.0 with various features:

* Server-side URL rewriting
* Clean error pages for debugging
* Virtual Host implementations
* Various header normalizations
* Cookie manipulations
* 301/302 redirects from within Varnish

### Common troubleshooting

Common list of errors and their fixes:

* [FetchError http first read error: -1 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable)](https://ma.ttias.be/varnish-fetcherror-http-first-read-error-1-11-resource-temporarily-unavailable/)
* [FetchError: straight insufficient bytes](https://ma.ttias.be/varnish-fetcherror-straight-insufficient-bytes/)
* [FetchError: Gunzip+ESI Failed at the very end](https://ma.ttias.be/varnish-fetcherror-testgunzip-gunzip-esi-failed-very-end/)

Basic troubleshooting:

* [Test if your Varnish VCL compiles and Varnish starts](https://ma.ttias.be/varnish-running-in-foreground-but-fails-to-run-as-servicedaemon/)
* [See which cookies are being stripped in your VCL](https://ma.ttias.be/varnish-tip-see-cookies-stripped-vcl/)
* [Reload Varnish VCL without losing cache data](https://ma.ttias.be/reload-varnish-vcl-without-losing-cache-data/)
* [Combine Apache'S HTTP authentication with Varnish IP whitelisting](https://ma.ttias.be/apache-http-authentication-with-x-forwarded-for-ip-whitelisting-in-varnish/)

There is already a newer version out: [Varnish 6 VCL config template](https://github.com/mattiasgeniar/varnish-6.0-configuration-templates).
